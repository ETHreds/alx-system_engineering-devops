This is what happens when type www.google.com in your browser and press Enter
When you type “https://www.google.com" into your browser and press enter, a series of events is triggered that ultimately leads to the website appearing on your screen. Here’s a breakdown of what happens:

DNS request: The first thing that happens is that your computer sends a request to a DNS (Domain Name System) server to translate the human-readable domain name (www.google.com) into an IP address. The IP address is a numerical label that is assigned to every device connected to the internet and is used to identify the device and locate it on the network.
TCP/IP: Once the IP address is obtained, your computer establishes a connection with the server using the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) suite. TCP/IP is a set of protocols that govern the way data is transmitted over the internet. It is responsible for breaking down the data into packets, transmitting them to their destination, and reassembling them back into their original form.
Firewall: Before the connection is established, the server may have a firewall in place to block unauthorized access. A firewall is a security system that controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. If the request passes the firewall, the connection is established.
HTTPS/SSL: Once the connection is established, the website’s server sends an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate to your computer to establish an encrypted connection. SSL is a security protocol that provides communication security over the internet. It uses an encryption key to secure the data transmitted between the server and the client (your computer).
Load-balancer: Depending on the size of the website, there may be multiple servers behind the scenes to handle the traffic. In such cases, there is usually a load-balancer in place to distribute the incoming requests evenly across the servers. This ensures that the website remains responsive and can handle a high volume of traffic.
Web server: Once the request reaches the web server, it is processed and the necessary files are retrieved. These may include HTML files, CSS files, JavaScript files, images, and other media.
Application server: If the website uses a server-side language like PHP or Ruby, the request may be passed on to an application server to be processed. The application server executes the code and returns the result to the web server.
Database: If the website requires access to a database, the web server or application server may make a request to a database server to retrieve the necessary data. The database server processes the request and returns the data to the web server or application server, which in turn sends it back to the client (your computer).
The final step is for the web server to send the processed files back to your computer, where they are rendered by your browser and displayed on the screen.
